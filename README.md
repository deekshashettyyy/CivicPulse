  <h1>Civic Pulse</h1>
  <p><strong>Agentic AI-powered civic issue reporting and intelligent city administration</strong></p>
</div>

## Overview

Cities struggle with civic issue management—potholes, water leaks, and infrastructure damage are often reported in duplicate, lack standard severity assessments, and overwhelm city administrators with noise. 

**Civic Pulse** solves this by putting an autonomous, multi-agent AI system between citizens and city administration. When a user snaps a photo of an issue, AI perception models extract context (category, severity, reasoning). Geohash-backed AI deduplication algorithms prevent noise, and a predictive admin dashboard forecasts city infrastructure risks over 14 days based on recent patterns.

## Features

- [x] **Agentic AI Perception**: Upload a photo; Gemini 2.5 Flash automatically classifies the category, writes a title/description, and scores severity (1-10) with reasoning.
- [x] **Smart AI Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate reports by cross-referencing new reports against open issues within a 100m radius using semantic similarity. Automatically escalates severity if the new image shows deterioration.
- [x] **Multi-Agent Traceability log**: Fully transparent trace engine where users and admins can see the reasoning of the Perception, Deduplication, Severity, and Orchestrator agents.
- [x] **Geospatial Issue Mapping**: Real-time interactive map (powered by Leaflet & Geofire) showing localized issues, colored by severity and status.
- [x] **Admin Predictive Insights Dash**: AI autonomously generates 14-day forecasts for city wards (e.g., "Waterlogging complaints predicted to rise 40%").
- [x] **Priority Queuing & Heatmaps**: Admin view features dynamic resolution tracking, risk scoring, and a geospatial heatmap of critical issues.
- [x] **Community Verification Engine**: Citizens can visually confirm nearby issues (+1) to build community trust scores and crowd-source validation.
- [x] **Gamified Leaderboard**: Users earn points for reporting accurately and verifying community issues.

## Agentic AI Capabilities
Civic Pulse does not treat AI as a mere chatbot; it orchestrates a specialized intelligence pipeline.

### Perception Agent
Extracts structured attributes, title tags, and a localized severity rating directly from an uploaded image using Gemini 2.5 Flash.

### Deduplication Agent
Prevents database bloating by calculating spatial bounds using the user's geohash, querying Firestore for reports within a 100-meter radius, and evaluating semantic similarity to automatically merge duplicate reports or escalate severity when necessary.

### Forecasting Agent
Continuously analyzes ward-level data within the administrative dashboard and generates predictive insights, identifying whether civic issues such as potholes, garbage accumulation, or water leakages are expected to increase or decrease over the next 14 days based on recent reporting patterns.
