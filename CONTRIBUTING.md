### Key commands to keep in mind:

## Style Guide & Best Practices

- **TypeScript**: Make sure to use proper TypeScript typing instead of resorting to `any`.
- **React & Hooks**: Use functional components with hooks. Keep components clean, modular, and reusable.
- **Styling**: We use Tailwind CSS v4. Stick to utility classes and follow the design guidelines. Avoid adding arbitrary inline CSS unless necessary.
- **AI Tracing & Deduplication**: If modifying agent workflows, ensure they log detailed step-by-step traces so users/admins can audit AI logic.
- **Git Commit Messages**: Keep commit messages concise, beginning with an imperative verb (e.g., `feat: add community verification counter`, `fix: map reload crash`).
